### Example: Real-Time Base for Dashboards

The following example illustrates a thin table designed to support fast
dashboard queries by limiting the number of columns and joins.

```sql
SELECT
    transaction_date,
    operation_id,
    originadora,
    tese,
    distribution_channel,
    client_type,
    SUM(amount_confirmed) AS total_volume,
    SUM(custody_amount)   AS total_custody
FROM int_base_confirmadas
GROUP BY
    transaction_date,
    operation_id,
    originadora,
    tese,
    distribution_channel,
    client_type;
