# Data Anonymization & Privacy

This repository contains analytics projects built on top of real-world
business scenarios. To ensure data privacy and confidentiality, all sensitive
information was anonymized or adapted for portfolio purposes.

## What was anonymized or removed

The following elements were fully removed, masked, or generalized across all
projects:

- Personally identifiable information (PII), such as:
  - client names
  - email addresses
  - phone numbers
  - personal identifiers
- Internal IDs and system-specific identifiers
- Financial values that could reveal real business performance
  (replaced by relative metrics, ranges, or representative examples)
- Sensitive operational metadata not relevant for analytical understanding

## What is preserved

While sensitive data was anonymized, the following aspects were intentionally
preserved to maintain analytical integrity:

- data structures and schemas
- transformation logic and business rules
- aggregation strategies and KPIs
- architectural decisions and trade-offs
- performance optimization techniques

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate analytical thinking, data
modeling, and decision-making processes — not to expose real client or business
data.

All examples should be interpreted as illustrative representations of real
analytics workflows.
