### Low-entry customers (< 30 index)

Customers entering below an index of 30 (≈30% of CAC) show low repeat
behavior and an average LTV index of ~115, only marginally above
acquisition cost.

Only ~19% make more than one investment over their lifetime, and less
than 3% reach an LTV above 900, indicating limited payback under a
high-touch commercial model.

## 🧩 Additional Strategic Implications

- Low-ticket acquisition strategies require either significantly lower
  CAC or highly scalable self-service models to remain sustainable.
- Scaling customer volume without sufficient lifetime value leads to
  value dilution rather than growth.
- Reducing the minimum entry threshold alone is insufficient to drive
  volume growth, indicating limited elasticity to entry price.
- Ticket strategy, acquisition channels and operating model must be
  evaluated together as part of the same economic system.
