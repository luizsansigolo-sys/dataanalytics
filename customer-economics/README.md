### Low-entry customers (< 30 index)

Customers entering below an index of 30 (≈30% of CAC) show low repeat
behavior and an average LTV index of ~115, only marginally above
acquisition cost.

Only ~19% make more than one investment over their lifetime, and less
than 3% reach an LTV above 900, indicating limited payback under a
high-touch commercial model.
