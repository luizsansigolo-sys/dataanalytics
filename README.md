## Next Steps

This repository is a living portfolio and may continue to evolve. Potential
next steps include:

- Integration of payment and cashflow data to enable revenue, payout, and
  profitability analysis
- Development of customer retention and lifecycle metrics
- Expansion of analytical marts to support additional executive KPIs
- Further optimization of query performance through incremental and
  materialized strategies
- Deeper integration between analytics outputs and operational workflows

These enhancements reflect natural extensions of the current architecture and
were already partially explored in previous BI tools.
